MATLAB script to compress images using Discreet Cosine Transform (DCT) and Huffman encoding technique. 
The energy compaction property of DCT helps improve the compression achieved by Huffman encoding. However, 
the process is lossy and results in some degree of error in the recovered image. The extent of error is 
measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE). MSE and compression ration can be controlled by selecting the 
appropriate DCT matrix.
